# JSON Site Tester

Edit the tests.json file to meet your needs. Then if you change the name or have multiple tests add the in the main.py file.

Currently supports input and button presses.

Future changes:
- add support for sucess/fail scenarios and output pass/fail in the commandline.
- modify main.py to check if the page was loaded and continue instead of using the wait command.
